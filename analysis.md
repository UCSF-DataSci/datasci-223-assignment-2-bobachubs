1. Import os and make to sure handle missing input_file to read in csv before converting to parquet
2. groupby changed to group_by for DataFrame attribute
3. Shape mismatch between number of bins and cut for bmi range --> exclude the two endpoints 10 and 60
4. Checked the results were not None in the main()
5. Overall, kept running the file and looking at the terminal errors and retracing

Results:
```
| bmi_range   | avg_glucose | patient_count | avg_age   |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| Underweight | 95.195115   | 26041         | 23.980646 |
| Obese       | 126.032016  | 3066409       | 33.82713  |
| Normal      | 108.004737  | 664064        | 31.888848 |
| Overweight  | 116.373363  | 1165360       | 32.880893 |
```

We observe most patients are overweight and obese, with larger avg_glucose levels as well. The average age is about the same for those Normal and above but lower for those underweight (~24 compared to > 31). This makes sense. 

Polar's features were efficient to group and summarize data in an efficient pipeline similar to SQL. It is also more memory efficient.
